#intro o variables 

#variables are abstract storage location we associate with a name

food = 'tacos'
name = 'alex'

print (food)
print ('my name is', name)

#dynamic typing mean variables can be reassigned 

food = "pizza" 


#execution flow is down the page 


#multiple assignment 

first, middle, last = 'alex', 'mj', 'kj'

print (middle)

#naming convention in python 

#variables use snake_case (lowercase, words separated by _ not spaces )
favorite_food = "snake"

#constant variables ( who's value will never chance) 
NUM_PI  = 3.14

#RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 

#----DONT START YOUR VARIABLE WITH A NUMBER 
# like this >> 1ST_NUMBER 
#like this >> NUM_1 = 1 


# snack_case (words separated with a number )




#----NO SYMBOLS  
#>>> jake&jill git i


#no reserved words
